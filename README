org.springframework.config.java.support.ConfigurationSupport Next Generation:
1. The only method left is Object getObject(FactoryBean) that converts FactoryBeans to real beans.
2. Injectable by @Autowired annotation into your @Configuration class.

Make no mistake, all the code is written by Chris Beams, of course.
